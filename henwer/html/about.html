        <a href="http://code.google.com/p/henwer/">HenWer</a> is a viewer for online 
        and local images. HenWer was written in Python using the wxPython graphical
        library.

        HenWer is a fork of <a href="http://code.google.com/p/manwer/">ManWer</a>.
        ManWer was originally written by Matteo Bana, however it seems that he
        abandoned his project.

        HenWer adds some new (and hopefully useful) features. HenWer is developed
        by Jabba Laci (<a href="mailto:jabba.laci@gmail.com">jabba.laci@gmail.com</a>).
        The source code is available at 
        <a href="https://github.com/jabbalaci/HenWer">GitHub</a>.
