KNOWN ISSUES
============

* When you launch henwer, sometimes the menubar doesn't appear.
  It seems to be a known bug with Ubuntu:
  https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/pythoncard/+bug/763864 .
  I have wxPython 2.8 but I still have this annoying bug.
  
* When you want to open a URL and you select a site, the program
  sometimes freezes. At this point I use a thread, so there must 
  be something wrong with that.

If you have a solution for these problems, let me know. Contributions
