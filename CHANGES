I didn't touch this project for 2 years :( Now it's time to polish
it a bit.
* By pressing 'Y' you can copy the absolute path of the current
  image to the clipboard (Linux only at the moment).
* As a command-line parameter, you can pass a directory name and
  henwer will open that folder automatically. "henwer ." also works,
  i.e. open the current directory.
