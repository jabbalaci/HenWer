OVERVIEW
========

HenWer is a simple image viewer for online and local images. The project 
was written in Python using the wxPython graphical library.

HenWer supports only one site at the moment (http://fetish.iiichan.net/)
but it is quite easy to write an extractor module for your favourite
site.

HenWer is a fork of ManWer (http://code.google.com/p/manwer/). ManWer was 
written by Matteo Bana, however it seems that he abandoned his project. 
HenWer adds some new (and hopefully useful) features.


START
=====

To execute the program, just launch start.py .

It is suggested that you customize a bit the file 'preferences'. Here specify 
correctly save_dir (where to save the images) and tmp_dir (for storing
temporary files).

After launching the program, you can get a help by pressing 'H'. Study well
the keyboard bindings because the majority of the features are only accessible
via the keyboard.


REQUIREMENTS
============

HenWer requires the following Python packages:

* wxPython 2.8 (http://www.wxpython.org/)
  [for Linux users: make sure to install version 2.8, not 2.6]
* PIL (http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/)
* BeautifulSoup (http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/)
  [currently this one is included in the distribution, but we may
  remove it in the future]
  
Make sure that they are installed.
  

USE CASES
=========

Let's see some typical use cases.

(1) You are browsing an online gallery and you like some images.

If you like an image then mark it to be saved by pressing 'S'. In the 
bottom left hand corner you'll have a feedback. You can also get some
extra information by pressing 'I'. 
ATTENTION! These images are NOT YET saved. You have to commit your
changes explicitly by pressing 'C' or by clicking on 'Commit' in the
toolbar.

(2) The online gallery is awesome, you want to get all those images.

Press 'A' to select all images to be saved, then press 'C' to commit
your changes. The images will be saved in the save_dir directory that
you specified in your 'preferences' file.

(3) You are browsing a local directory and you want to delete some images.

If you dislike an image, just press 'D'. When you are done, commit
your changes with 'C'. HenWer will stay at the current image or, if
it's deleted, it will position you intelligently to the next image.

(4) If you would like to see an image as your wallpaper, mark it with 'W'.
After commit it'll be saved to your wallpapers_dir (specified in the
'preferences' file).

(5) You like a gallery, you want to get all the images and then you
    want to browse them locally.
    
Select all images with 'A', then commit with 'C' to save them. When
ready, choose 'Options' -> 'Switch to local dir.'. It also works when
you save just some images.


IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
====================

Or: HOW TO WRITE AN EXTRACTOR MODULE FOR YOUR FAVOURITE SITE.

For example, a normal module will only need the following methods:
 - gather_gallery_list: 
       returns a tuple of two lists, containing the list of galleries and their URLs
 - get_referer:
       some sites try to protect their contents, you might need to use this trick
 - get_relative_save_dir:
       When the user chooses the site and the gallery, this function will combine
       them to a directory name where the images will be saved. This combined
       directory will be created under save_dir.

The image URLs from a given HTML page are extracted with screenscraper.py .
 
Place your module in the backend directory, and you're done. Your module will be avaiable
for use in the Open URL dialog.

Other infos are avaiable in the source code.
